## Our Mission

We're building tools to simplify the development lifecycle, making deployment and development more accessible, efficient, and enjoyable. Our focus is on creating lightweight, powerful solutions that respect developers' workflow and eliminate unnecessary complexity.

## 🚀 Our Projects

### [AtlasServer-Core](https://github.com/AtlasServer-Core/AtlasServer-Core)

**A lightweight and efficient deployment platform for Python web applications**

<p>
  <a href="https://pypi.org/project/atlasserver/"><img src="https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/atlasserver.svg" alt="PyPI Version"></a>
  <a href="https://pypi.org/project/atlasserver/"><img src="https://img.shields.io/pypi/dm/atlasserver" alt="PyPI Downloads"></a>
  <a href="https://github.com/AtlasServer-Core/AtlasServer-Core/"><img src="https://img.shields.io/github/stars/AtlasServer-Core/AtlasServer-Core.svg" alt="GitHub Stars"></a>
</p>

AtlasServer-Core radically simplifies the deployment process for Flask, FastAPI, and Django applications. With both a web interface and CLI, it eliminates dependency on costly cloud services for testing and development.

```bash
pip install atlasserver
```

💻 **Fast deploy. No cloud. Just code.**  
*From developers to developers.*

### [AtlasAI-CLI](https://github.com/AtlasServer-Core/AtlasAI-CLI)

**AI-powered command line assistant for developers**

AtlasAI-CLI automatically analyzes projects, recommends optimal deployment configurations, and answers general queries about your system and development tasks. Works both with AtlasServer and as a standalone tool.

```bash
pip install atlasai-cli
```

🤖 **Your intelligent, easy-to-use terminal**  
*From developers to developers.*
